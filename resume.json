            "period": "Jan 2024 – Jun 2024",
            "description": "Developed a sarcasm detection system: Utilized machine learning techniques, including LSTM networks, to effectively identify sarcasm and sentiment in text data, leveraging Python with TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn as well NLP for model development. Text preprocessing: Applied lemmatization to reduce words to their root form and tokenization to split text into meaningful units, enhancing semantic analysis with GloVe embeddings. Enhanced model accuracy: Analyzed punctuation marks and emojis to improve detection accuracy, ensuring the model effectively captured nuanced expressions of sarcasm. Data Source: News Headline Dataset. Accuracy Score: 93.32%"
